# Mechanism Reduction with GA and GNN

This repository implements an end-to-end pipeline for reducing chemical
reaction mechanisms.  A genetic algorithm (GA) searches for a minimal set of
species while a graph neural network (GNN) guides the initial population based
on species importance.  Reactor simulations are performed with Cantera and the
quality of a reduction is assessed using progress variables and ignition delay
metrics.

## Running the Pipeline

python -m testing.run_tests --out results --steps 200 --tf 1.0

The command loads the `data/gri30.yaml` mechanism, executes a batch reactor
simulation and applies the GA reduction.  Adjust `--steps` or `--tf` to control
the integration granularity and final time. CSV files and plots are written to
`results/`.  Additional debugging information is stored in `debug_fitness.csv`
along with generation-wise PV/temperature plots.
